# Behaviors



## Description

This was made to control system based event in a timely manner. The main idea here is to have schedule of timed commands that can be executed without the need of supervision. kind of like an alarm clock.. when the time hits the command executes. The system is built in a way that you can specific via a json file on how you want the alarm to behave. If you need to to repeat everyday on specific time or just on a random selected hour. This is especially helpful for ppl who need to run maintence events on the system but dont want to actually wait for the events to happen.
